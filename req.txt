PROJECT REQUIREMENTS OVERVIEW 
The “Cure” Hospital Management System (CHMS) is designed to support a comprehensive set of 
functionalities across multiple modules to streamline the operations of medical centers. The system follows a 
multi-tenant architecture with distinct roles for Super Admin, Tenant Admin, Center Admin, and various staff 
members. Each module has been developed to handle specific tasks and ensure smooth and efficient 
management of the healthcare facilities. Below is an overview of the project requirements based on the 
detailed module breakdown: 
Features of the project :  
This “Cure” Hospital Management System (CHMS) is designed to streamline the entire workflow of a 
medical center, from patient registration to reporting and inventory management. Patients can register 
themselves online or be registered by a receptionist, and each patient will be assigned a unique identification 
number containing details such as the appointment location and patient-specific information. Patients are able 
to book, modify, and make payments for appointments either online or at the reception desk, with restrictions 
preventing appointment changes within 36 hours of the scheduled time. After booking, patients receive 
confirmation and reminder notifications via email or SMS, including alerts one day and one hour prior to their 
appointment. 
Upon arrival at the medical center, patients consult with the doctor, who records relevant medical history, 
symptoms, and prescribed treatments directly into the system. The doctor may also prescribe medications or 
request lab tests, all of which are automatically integrated into the patient’s medical records. After the 
consultation, the doctor enters the consultation fee, which is processed by the cashier. Patients then proceed to 
the cashier, where they present their ID, and the cashier retrieves the billing information and provides a printed 
receipt. 
Following payment, patients visit the pharmacy, where their prescription is verified, and the pharmacist 
dispenses the medication. The system automatically deducts the issued medicines from the pharmacy inventory 
in real time, ensuring accurate stock levels. The pharmacy management system maintains all stock and pricing 
details, with built-in alerts to notify the admin of low stock. 
Additionally, the HMS allows administrators to generate detailed end-of-day reports on various metrics, 
including the number of patients seen, medications dispensed, stock levels, and tax payments. It also includes an 
HR module for tracking staff attendance and managing payroll, with features to generate salary history and 
attendance reports for all medical center employees. This integrated system ensures smooth operations across 
departments and enhances overall efficiency within the healthcare facility.
